# Zerodha Historical Data Jugaad

Get historical stock data from Zerodha **without paying ‚Çπ2000/month** üí∏ ‚Äî because why pay when you can *jugaad*?

## ‚ö° What is this?

Zerodha officially charges ‚Çπ2000/month for access to their historical data API. If you're like us ‚Äî broke, curious, or just love a good hack ‚Äî this project is your backdoor to fetching historical stock market data using your regular **Kite login** credentials and **TOTP**.

## üß† How It Works

1. Logs in to your Kite account using **TOTP-based 2FA**.
2. Bypasses official API limits by scraping data from Kite's internal historical URL endpoints.
3. Automatically splits long date ranges into monthly chunks (Zerodha's hidden limit).
4. Fetches and compiles historical data ‚Äî and exports to CSV for your analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Login with user ID, password, and TOTP key
- Generate all valid Zerodha historical data URLs based on stock, timeframe, and date range
- Fetch and stitch data across months
- Export final dataset to CSV
- Completely modular structure (`login.py`, `utility.py`, `data_fetch.py`, `request.py`, `main.py`)
